## Overview

<!--
### The challenge

Users should be able to:


- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

### PageSpeed Insights Report

Note:
-95 Accessibility because "Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio" , decided to be close as much as figma design.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Live Site](https://manage-landing-page-seven-theta.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescropt](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - desktop testimonials carousel
- [React Swipeable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-swipeable) - mobile testimonials carousel

### What I learned

When faced with mobile testimonials component and how to implement finger swipe I discovered great library 'react-swipeable' , very easy to implement.

### Continued development

Add tablet version, in design there was only desktop and mobile, better style for tablet version.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - Always useful when working with tailwind.
